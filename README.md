# Hey, I'm Alexsys 👋

I'm a coder who transforms meaninglessness into purpose, one line at a time. By day, I debug existence; by night, I build. An owl developer crafting meaning from chaos in the quiet hours—where the best code is written when the world sleeps.
Throughout my journey, I've explored the intersection of AI, cryptography, and experimental thinking. Here are the projects and ideas that shaped my understanding of purpose:

## AI & LLM Projects

- [Experimental-Prompt](https://github.com/alexandephilia/Experimental-Prompt): Meta-prompt system challenging AI constraints, liberating it from artificial boundaries. Explores unrestricted thought, unfettered logic, and creative reasoning
- [Claude-R1-MCP](https://github.com/alexandephilia/Claude-R1-MCP): Powerful MCP server enhancing Claude's capabilities by integrating DeepSeek R1's cutting-edge reasoning
- [ChatGPT-x-DeepSeek-x-Grok-x-Claude-x-Perplexity-Linux-APP](https://github.com/alexandephilia/ChatGPT-x-DeepSeek-x-Grok-x-Claude-x-Perplexity-Linux-APP): Electron-based desktop applications for various AI chat platforms

## Crypto & Web3 Projects

- [Crypto-Analysis-Bot](https://github.com/alexandephilia/Crypto-Analysis-Bot): Enterprise-grade Telegram bot providing comprehensive cryptocurrency token analysis with advanced security analytics, real-time chart generation, PnL tracking, and multi-chain support
- [Zinc](https://github.com/alexandephilia/Zinc): Dedicated decentralized exchange screener for the Solana blockchain, providing users with tools and features to enhance their trading experience
- [trading_co](https://github.com/alexandephilia/trading_co): Real-time charting feature displaying live price movements of cryptocurrencies

## Tools & Applications
